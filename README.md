# 2022-Spring-Applied-Data-
Final Project
This project is composed of two sections 
In the first section, the price data of major crypto currencies are collected and wrangled into a single data set. 
Then, leveraging a clustering algorithm, I tried to see if i can categorize (classify) them into several groups based on their price movement over a certain period. 
Here, I collected the price data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory. 

In the second section, I tried to select one representative coin from each group that I classified the coins into from the first section (cluster). Then I tried to see if it'd be possible to predict a price of major asset class (U.S 10 Years Yield, S&P500, Nadaq Tech 100, Tesla stock, Gold, U.S Dallor Index) based on the price movement of the representative coins. 
I collected the related data from https://www.marketwatch.com/


This project, I hope, will be meaningful and somewhat informative for those who invest in the cryptomarkets in a way that they can refer to my clustering results so they can diversify their portfolios by investing in coins from different clusters.

"Final_Project_sl4876.Rmd" is the final code.
